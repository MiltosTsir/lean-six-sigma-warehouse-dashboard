## Project Overview

This project applies the **Lean Six Sigma DMAIC methodology** to a **simulated warehouse and inventory management process**, using **Excel** and **Tableau** for analysis and visualization.

It demonstrates how Lean Six Sigma tools can help reduce **picking errors**, **stockouts**, and **inefficiencies** in warehouse operations.

---

## Objective

Reduce operational waste and improve performance by:
- Minimizing picking errors
- Reducing stockout incidents
- Optimizing picking time and inventory control
- Monitoring improvements via a real-time dashboard

## Methodology â€“ DMAIC

| Phase    | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Define**   | Identified high error rate, stockouts, and variability in lead time |
| **Measure**  | Calculated KPIs using Excel (e.g., picking error rate, stockout rate, lead time) |
| **Analyze**  | Root causes identified using segmentation & Pareto charts |
| **Improve**  | Layout redesign, picker training, smarter reorder point logic |
| **Control**  | Tableau dashboard tracks key metrics over time |

## Dataset

- **Rows:** 30,000 simulated warehouse transactions  
- **Generated:** Synthetically, for educational & portfolio purposes  
- **Key Fields:**
  - Order metadata: `Order ID`, `Order Date`, `Region`, `SKU`
  - Process metrics: `Units Ordered`, `Units Shipped`, `Picking Time`, `Lead Time`
  - Inventory metrics: `Inventory Level`, `Reorder Point`, `Stockout`, `Order Accuracy (%)`

## Key Outcomes (Simulated)

| Metric                | Before     | After       | Change    |
|-----------------------|------------|-------------|-----------|
| Picking Error Rate    | 10.5%      | **8.58%**    | â†“ 18%     |
| Stockout Rate         | 32.5%      | **25.32%**   | â†“ 22%     |
| Order Accuracy        | 89%        | **91.42%**   | â†‘ 2.7%    |
| Lead Time             | 6.2 days   | **5.51 days**| â†“ 11%     |
