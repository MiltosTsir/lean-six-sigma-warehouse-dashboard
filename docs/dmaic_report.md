# DMAIC Report: Lean Six Sigma Warehouse & Inventory Optimization

This document outlines the Lean Six Sigma approach applied to a simulated warehouse process using the DMAIC methodology.

---

## Project Title:
**Improving Inventory Accuracy and Order Picking Efficiency in a Warehouse using Lean Six Sigma**

---

## DEFINE Phase

### Process Description
The process under analysis is the **warehouse order fulfillment** workflow, focusing on the stages of **order picking and inventory availability**. Each order is picked, packed, and shipped from warehouse stock based on customer demand.

### Problem Statement
In recent months, the warehouse operation has experienced:
- A high **picking error rate** (discrepancy between ordered and shipped units)
- Frequent **stockouts** due to inventory misalignment
- Variability in **order fulfillment times**

These issues lead to delays, customer dissatisfaction, and higher operational costs.

### Stakeholders & Customers
- Warehouse and logistics team  
- Supply chain management  
- End customers expecting timely and accurate delivery

### Critical to Quality (CTQ) Requirements

| Metric              | Current (Est.) | Target        |
|---------------------|----------------|---------------|
| Picking Error Rate  | ~13%           | < 5%          |
| Stockout Rate       | ~17%           | < 3%          |
| Order Accuracy      | ~89%           | > 95%         |
| Avg. Lead Time      | ~5 days        | < 3 days      |

### Scope
- Inventory management (stock levels, reorder points)
- Order picking process (accuracy, time)
- Shipping preparation (excluding external carrier performance)

### Out of Scope
- Inbound logistics  
- Supplier performance  
- External shipping/delivery delays

# MEASURE Phase

In this phase, KPIs were calculated using Excel on a cleaned dataset of 30,000 simulated warehouse transactions.

## Key Metrics Calculated

| KPI                      | Value        |
|--------------------------|--------------|
| Picking Error Rate (%)   | 8.58         |
| Stockout Rate (%)        | 25.32        |

| Avg. Picking Time (min)  | 15           |
| Avg. Lead Time (days     | 5.51         |

All calculations were performed using Excel formulas and PivotTables. Financial impact was also estimated based on error costs:

### Average Shipping Cost by Region and Delivery Method

To evaluate cost efficiency, we analyzed the **average shipping cost** by **Region** and **Delivery Method** using pivot tables and conditional formatting in Excel.

| Region | Express (‚Ç¨) | Same Day (‚Ç¨) | Standard (‚Ç¨) | Avg Total (‚Ç¨) |
|--------|-------------|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| East   | 27,33       | 27,60        | 27,37         | 27,43  
| North  | 27,72       | 27,16        | **28,00**     | 27,63  
| South  | 27,88       | 27,77        | 27,48         | **27,71**  
| West   | 27,49       | 27,56        | 27,73         | 27,59  
| **Overall Avg** | **27,61** | **27,52** | **27,65** | **27,59**

**Conclusions**:
- The **South** region has the highest average overall shipping cost.
- The **North** region shows the **highest Standard shipping cost** at ‚Ç¨28.00.
- **Same Day delivery** is consistently more expensive than Express or Standard in most regions.

These insights indicate that:
- Cost optimization should focus on the **Standard shipping process in North**, and
- Strategic adjustments may reduce excessive costs in the **South**.

### Order Accuracy by Shipping Method

| Shipping Method | Avg. Accuracy (%) | Std. Deviation |
|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Same Day         | 99.52%            | 2.52%  
| Standard         | 99.50%            | 2.59%  
| Express          | 99.54%            | 2.44%  

**Conclusion**: Standard shipping shows slightly higher variability.

---

### Order Accuracy by Product Category

| Product Category | Avg. Accuracy (%) | Std. Deviation |
|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Apparel          | 99.53%            | 2.49%  
| Electronics      | 99.52%            | 2.51%  
| Furniture        | 99.51%            | 2.55%  
| Toys             | 99.51%            | 2.52%  

---

### Order Accuracy by Region

| Region | Avg. Accuracy (%) | Std. Deviation |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| East   | 99.56%            | 2.43%  
| North  | 99.54%            | 2.46%  
| South  | 99.50%            | 2.53%  
| West   | 99.47%            | 2.63%  

**Conclusion**: The West region shows the lowest performance and highest variability.

---

### üìä Boxplot Analysis

Boxplots were created to explore variation and potential instability in key performance metrics across different categories and regions.

---

#### üì¶ Lead Time per Region

The boxplot for **Lead Time per Region** revealed that the **West region** has the highest variability and several outliers, indicating inconsistent performance and potential delays.

This supports the need for targeted improvements in process standardization or training in that region.

---

#### ‚è± Picking Time per Product Category

The **Picking Time per Product Category** boxplot showed that categories like **Furniture** and **Electronics** had wider interquartile ranges and outliers.

This suggests differences in picking complexity or layout efficiency across categories and justifies further investigation or layout redesign.

### üöö Shipping Cost vs. Picking Time

Shipping cost was analyzed by **quartiles of picking time**, instead of scatter plots, for better interpretability.

| Picking Time Range | Avg. Shipping Cost (‚Ç¨) |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| 0‚Äì10 min            | 27.61  
| 11‚Äì15 min           | 27.43  
| 16‚Äì20 min           | 27.74  
| 21+ min             | 27.63
