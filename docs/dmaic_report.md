# DMAIC Report: Lean Six Sigma Warehouse & Inventory Optimization

This document outlines the Lean Six Sigma approach applied to a simulated warehouse process using the DMAIC methodology.

---

## 📌 Project Title:
**Improving Inventory Accuracy and Order Picking Efficiency in a Warehouse using Lean Six Sigma**

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement (Define)

Order fulfillment errors and inventory inaccuracies lead to delays, stockouts, and increased operational costs. The goal of this project is to identify inefficiencies in the warehouse process and improve inventory control and picking accuracy using Lean Six Sigma tools.

---

## 📏 Metrics & Data (Measure)

We used a dataset of 30,000 warehouse order records with the following key metrics:

- **Picking Error Rate** = % of orders with discrepancies between ordered and shipped units  
- **Stockout Rate** = % of orders where inventory level < reorder point  
- **Order Accuracy (%)**  
- **Lead Time (days)** for completed orders  
- **Warehouse Picking Time (minutes)**

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis (Analyze)

Using tools like Pareto charts and basic data segmentation, we identified:

- High error rates in specific product categories and regions  
- Delays concentrated in same-day shipping methods  
- Stockouts driven by low reorder point thresholds or high demand spikes

---

## 🚀 Suggested Improvements (Improve)

Based on the analysis, we proposed:

- Increase training for warehouse staff to reduce picking errors  
- Review and adjust reorder points for high-risk SKUs  
- Improve layout efficiency to reduce average picking time  
- Track real-time inventory levels more frequently

---

## 📊 Control Plan (Control)

To ensure sustained improvement:

- Set up dashboards in Tableau to track KPIs over time  
- Use Excel for ongoing data updates and monitoring  
- Create weekly reports on picking accuracy and stock levels  
- Set alerts for stockouts and lead time deviations

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Excel** – Data cleaning, KPIs, pivot tables  
- **Tableau** – Visual dashboard to monitor performance

---

## ✅ Outcome (Simulated)

- Picking error rate reduced by 18%  
- Stockout incidents decreased by 22%  
- Average picking time improved by 9%  
- Order accuracy increased to 96.5%
